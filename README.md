# Classifying Filipino Komiks using Convolutional Neural Networks
Authors: Akemi Ray A. Goshi and Rizza DC. Mercado

Filipino komiks is an art form that has a long history in the Philippines. Analysis of visual style of Filipino comics using computational methods, particularly on machine learning, lacks literature for discussion. This study aims to identify whether Filipino comics have a visual style that is identifiable from non-Filipino comics using convolutional neural networks (CNN). A binary image and an RGB histogram image were generated from both whole page and single panel formats and were used as input to the classifier along with the original image. Results show that histogram input were able to classify Filipino comics from non-Filipino comics with an F1 score of 0.91 for the whole page format and 0.96 for the single panel. Additionally, histogram input has shown to correctly identify the comic works to the artist.
